# This is my final project for PHP and MySQL class at Berkeley City College, Spring 2016.
# The project simulates a college website that allows new student to register their accounts, choose their
# major and enroll to the courses according to the chosen major.
# The project is written in PHP and SQL.
# CSS and JavaScript were mainly borrowed from other open source projects.
